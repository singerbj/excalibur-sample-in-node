# Excalibur Platformer Sample running in Node.js env

Notably, take a look at 'src/browserShim.ts' that allows for this to work. It's a massive hack but kinda pumped I got it to work.

I had to make a bunch of modifications to the sample-platformer project to get it to work, hence why im just pushing to a seperate repo.

Using Node.js v18.7.1

## Running locally

* Using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Run the `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run the `npm run start` to build the project and immediately start it
